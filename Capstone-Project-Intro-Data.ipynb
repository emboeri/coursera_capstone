In the pursuit of a happier, healthier experience living in Los Angeles, this project aims to find the most walkable cities in the greater Los Angeles area where one can reside without having a car. \n\nMeasuring neighborhood walkability can also provide significant benefits for cities looking to increase growth and attract more people, or for businesses to determine ideal locations to constuct new properties, like apartment buildings or storefronts. For more information on the economic and social benefits of walkable cities, the following 2018 article published in Vox provides a great overview: ['Why walkable cities are good for the economy, according to a city planner'](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/26/18025000/walkable-city-walk-score-economy)",
